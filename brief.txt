Your challenge is to build out this jobs board using a local data.json to retrieve the data. Your goal is to try to get your project looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local data.json file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack application!

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research prefers-color-scheme in CSS.
Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application
Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.

Note: This used to be the GitHub Jobs API challenge. Unfortunately, that API was deprecated, so we've created a local data.json file with a similar data structure. If you've already taken the challenge using the API, your solution may be broken. In that case, you can download the files again and refactor your code to work with the new local JSON data.
